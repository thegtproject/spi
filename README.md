#Simple Pascal Interpreter - Based on ruslanspivak's project that was written in Python.

It is currently up to Part 10 of the series, https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part10/

Currently I am passing around all number representations as float64 until I come up with a good way to support many different types.
